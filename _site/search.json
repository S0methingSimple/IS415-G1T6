Hence to further narrow our subsequent analysis we will group robbery as one category and vehicle theft as the other since they are highly correlated.\n\npiv_crime_df_mys &lt;- piv_crime_df_mys %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    robbery = `assault-robbery_gang_armed` + `assault-robbery_gang_unarmed` + \n              `assault-robbery_solo_armed` + `assault-robbery_solo_unarmed`,\n    vehicle_theft = `property-theft_vehicle_lorry` + `property-theft_vehicle_motorcar` + \n                    `property-theft_vehicle_motorcycle`\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-`assault-robbery_gang_armed`, -`assault-robbery_gang_unarmed`, \n         -`assault-robbery_solo_armed`, -`assault-robbery_solo_unarmed`,\n         -`property-theft_vehicle_lorry`, -`property-theft_vehicle_motorcar`, \n         -`property-theft_vehicle_motorcycle`) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~str_remove(., \"^assault-|^property-\"))\n\npiv_crime_df_mys\n\nThe final crime type correlation matrix should look like the following.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(cor(st_drop_geometry(piv_crime_df_mys)[, 4:10]),\n         lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\",\n               tl.srt = 45, \n               tl.cex = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Analysis\n\n\n\nAcross the board it seems like only robbery have high correlation with vehicle_theft. However we will not be dropping either as they are key variables we would like extract insights from."

    "text": "This study investigates the spatial distribution and evolution of crime in Malaysia over recent years. By employing advanced spatial analysis techniques, we aim to identify hotspots, coldspots, and emerging trends in crime patterns. Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of crime incidents, including location, type, and date of occurrence.\n\n\n\n\nAuthors: Azizul Ahmad, Tarmiji Masron, Syahrul Nizam Junaini, Mohamad Hardyman Barawi, Mohd Sofian Redzuan, Yoshinari Kimura, Norita Anak Jubit, Luqman Haqim Bismelah, Asykal Syakinah Mohd Ali\nSource\nThis study focuses on property crime hotspots in urban centers like Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya, utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map trends between 2015 and 2020. The study highlights how property crimes cluster in specific areas, enabling more efficient policing strategies like hotspot policing. This research significantly contributes to crime prevention strategies, particularly in high-density regions, by offering data-driven approaches to law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\nAuthors: Syerrina Zakaria, Nuzlinda Abdul Rahman\nSource\nThis study applies Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to analyze crime in Peninsular Malaysia. By using GWR, the research provides a nuanced understanding of how different socio-economic and geographic factors impact crime rates across districts. This spatial model allows for better understanding of crime variation and helps identify significant crime factors that differ from one district to another, enhancing targeted interventions.\n\n\n\nAuthor: Syerrina Zakaria, Nuzlinda Abdul Rahman\nSource\nFor this study, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) has been employed to investigate violent crime patterns. This method identifies the spatial distribution of violent crimes and suggests regional variations in crime rates, enabling policymakers to focus on crime-prone areas.\nThese studies collectively demonstrate the value of spatial analysis in understanding crime patterns, offering policymakers and law enforcement crucial insights for strategic planning and resource allocation.\n\n\n\n\nSpatial analysis plays a crucial role in understanding crime patterns by revealing how crimes are distributed across geographic areas and identifying key locations where criminal activities concentrate. Through advanced techniques like hotspot analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial autocorrelation, spatial analysis enables researchers to detect high-risk areas (hotspots) and safer regions (coldspots).\nThis geographic insight helps to visualize crime trends, assess environmental or socio-economic factors influencing crime rates, and predict future crime occurrences. In the context of Malaysia, spatial analysis can highlight the impact of urban development, population density, or infrastructure on crime, enabling policymakers and law enforcement agencies to allocate resources more efficiently and design targeted crime prevention strategies based on geographic evidence.\nBy identifying patterns and trends at both macro and micro levels, we can better understand the dynamics of crime and to mitigate its impact on society.\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to investigate the spatial patterns and relationships of various crime types in Malaysia over time. By employing spatial analysis techniques, we aim to:\n\nIdentify hotspots and coldspots of crime.\nAssess the spatial autocorrelation of crime rates.\nExplore the impact of neighboring crime rates on local crime patterns.\nUnderstand how crime patterns vary across different regions.\nIdentify emerging hotspots where crime rates are rapidly increasing."
