    "text": "This study investigates the spatial distribution and evolution of crime in Malaysia over recent years. By employing advanced spatial analysis techniques, we aim to identify hotspots, coldspots, and emerging trends in crime patterns. Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of crime incidents, including location, type, and date of occurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to investigate the spatial patterns and relationships of various crime types in Malaysia over time. By employing spatial analysis techniques, we aim to:\n\nIdentify hotspots and coldspots of crime.\nAssess the spatial autocorrelation of crime rates.\nExplore the impact of neighboring crime rates on local crime patterns.\nUnderstand how crime patterns vary across different regions.\nIdentify emerging hotspots where crime rates are rapidly increasing."
