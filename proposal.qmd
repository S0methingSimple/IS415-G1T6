# 1. Introduction

This study investigates the spatial distribution and evolution of crime in Malaysia over recent years. By employing advanced spatial analysis techniques, we aim to identify hotspots, coldspots, and emerging trends in crime patterns. Our analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset of crime incidents, including location, type, and date of occurrence.

## 1.1 Literature Review

### **Criminological insights: A comprehensive spatial analysis of crime hot spots of property offenses in Malaysia's urban centers**

This study focuses on **property crime hotspots** in urban centers like Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya, utilizing **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** to map trends between 2015 and 2020. The study highlights how property crimes cluster in specific areas, enabling more efficient policing strategies like hotspot policing. This research significantly contributes to crime prevention strategies, particularly in high-density regions, by offering data-driven approaches to law enforcement agencies.

This study applies **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)** to analyze crime in Peninsular Malaysia. By using GWR, the research provides a nuanced understanding of how different socio-economic and geographic factors impact crime rates across districts. This spatial model allows for better understanding of crime variation and helps identify significant crime factors that differ from one district to another, enhancing targeted interventions.

For this study, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) has been employed to investigate violent crime patterns. This method identifies the spatial distribution of violent crimes and suggests regional variations in crime rates, enabling policymakers to focus on crime-prone areas.

These studies collectively demonstrate the value of spatial analysis in understanding crime patterns, offering policymakers and law enforcement crucial insights for strategic planning and resource allocation.

## 1.2 Significance of Spatial Analysis in understanding Crime patterns

Spatial analysis plays a crucial role in understanding crime patterns by revealing how crimes are distributed across geographic areas and identifying key locations where criminal activities concentrate. Through advanced techniques like hotspot analysis, kernel density estimation, and spatial autocorrelation, spatial analysis enables researchers to detect high-risk areas (hotspots) and safer regions (coldspots).

This geographic insight helps to visualize crime trends, assess environmental or socio-economic factors influencing crime rates, and predict future crime occurrences. In the context of Malaysia, spatial analysis can highlight the impact of urban development, population density, or infrastructure on crime, enabling policymakers and law enforcement agencies to allocate resources more efficiently and design targeted crime prevention strategies based on geographic evidence.

By identifying patterns and trends at both macro and micro levels, we can better understand the dynamics of crime and to mitigate its impact on society.

## 1.3 Research Objective

The primary objective of this project is to investigate the spatial patterns and relationships of various crime types in Malaysia over time. By employing spatial analysis techniques, we aim to:

-   Identify hotspots and coldspots of crime.

-   Assess the spatial autocorrelation of crime rates.

-   Explore the impact of neighboring crime rates on local crime patterns.

-   Understand how crime patterns vary across different regions.

-   Identify emerging hotspots where crime rates are rapidly increasing.

# 2. Methodology

## 2.1 Data Collection and Preparation:

-   Acquire Malaysia Crime [data](https://data.gov.my/data-catalogue/crime_district?state=johor&district=all&category=assault&type=all&visual=table) by district, year and by type.
-   Inspecting and understanding data fields.
-   Preparing the data for analysis, including spatial data wrangling and standardization.

## 2.2 Spatial Analysis Techniques:

1.  **EDA Choropleth Maps**\
    Visualize crime rates across Malaysia over time and by crime type using color-coded polygons.
2.  **Spatial Lag Model\
    **Calculate the spatial lag of crime rates to assess the impact of neighboring crime rates.
3.  **Global Spatial Autocorrelation\
    **Use Moran's I or Geary's C to measure the overall spatial pattern of crime rates.
4.  **Local Spatial Autocorrelation\
    **Employing LISA maps to identify hotspots and coldspots of crime.
5.  **Emerging Hotspot Analysis\
    **Analyze changes in crime rates over time to identify areas with rapidly increasing crime rates.

# 3. Analysis in Detail

### 1. **Choropleth Map for EDA (+ Histogram)**

(Done by: Yee Kai)

A Choropleth Map for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with a histogram will be at the core of this project. This interactive map will allow users to **view crime hotspots** and filter them based on different conditions, providing an overview of crime rates across Malaysia over time. Users can adjust a slider to select the year and use a dropdown menu to choose the crime type, with the map displaying the crime rate using a color scale.

### 2. **Spatial Lag Model (Various)**

(Done by: Yee Kai)

A Spatial Lag Model will also be used to assess the impact of neighboring crime rates on specific locations. This will be visualized through a **choropleth map showing spatial lag values** for different crime types, with high lag values meaning that neighboring areas have high crime rates.

### 3. **Global Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I and/or Geary's C)**

(Done by: Jenna)

Global Spatial Autocorrelation will be analyzed using Moran's I and/or Geary's C statistics to assess the overall spatial pattern of crime rates across Malaysia. This will be represented by a choropleth map showing **Moran's I or Geary's C values** for different crime types, with high positive values indicating clustering of similar values and high negative values indicating dispersion of dissimilar values.

### 4. **Local Spatial Autocorrelation (Local Moran's I - LISA Map)**

(Done by: Jenna)

Local Spatial Autocorrelation will be examined using Local Moran's I, visualized through a LISA map. This helps identify **hotspots and coldspots of crime**, with hotspots having high positive values and coldspots having high negative values.

### 5. **Emerging Hotspot Analysis**

(Done by: Jeffery)

We will also use Emerging Hotspot Analysis to identify areas where crime rates are increasing rapidly. This will be visualized through a choropleth map showing the **change in crime rates over time for different areas**, allowing for the identification of areas with significant increases in crime rates being shown as emerging hotspots.

# 4. Expected Outcomes

This project will provide valuable insights into the spatial dynamics of crime in Malaysia. The findings can assist in determining resource allocation and policy development. By understanding the factors influencing crime patterns, policymakers can take targeted measures to reduce crime rates and improve public safety. The following are the expected outcome of our analysis

-   Identification of areas with high and low crime concentrations.

-   Assessment of spatial autocorrelation and clustering patterns.

-   Understanding of the relationship between crime rates and neighboring areas.

-   Identification of emerging hotspots for targeted crime prevention efforts.

-   Insights into regional variations in crime patterns.
